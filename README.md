# Twitter PT Sentiment Analysis

This repo was made as an example usage of LeIA, a Python package for performing sentiment analysis by lexical approaches.

The objective of this repo is to analyze twitter pre-processed data and turn it into a dataset that can be used for sentiment analysis, using lexical analysis as previous approach.

This was made for my thesis.

pip install -r requirements.txt
